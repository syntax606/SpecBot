# SpecBot

A Slack bot that answers engineer questions from your Confluence specs, runs live AI-assisted brainstorm sessions, and logs all spec activity to a master audit trail.

Built with Claude (Anthropic), Recall.ai, Confluence, and Slack. Deployable on Railway in under an hour.

---

## What it does

### 1. Spec Q&A
Engineers ask questions in Slack. SpecBot searches your Confluence spec pages, passes the relevant content to Claude, and returns a grounded answer with source links — no hallucination, no invention beyond what the spec says.

```
/specbot What is the error handling flow for the login feature?
@SpecBot Does the spec cover offline mode?
```

### 2. Live brainstorm → proposal (Slack thread)
Start a live session in Slack. Talk through the feature idea in the thread naturally. SpecBot builds a structured proposal in Confluence as you go, updating it every 60 seconds. When you're done, one command finalises and publishes it.

```
/specbot brainstorm
```

### 3. Live brainstorm → proposal (Google Meet)
SpecBot joins your Google Meet via Recall.ai, listens to the conversation in real time, and writes the proposal directly to a Confluence draft page as you talk. When the call ends, the proposal is finalised automatically.

```
/specbot live https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

### 4. Spec activity log
Every spec-related action is recorded to a master "Spec Activity Log" Confluence page — who asked what, who ran a brainstorm, who edited a spec page directly, and when. Newest entries appear first.

## Slack commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/specbot <question>` | Answer a question from the spec |
| `/specbot brainstorm` | Start a live Slack thread brainstorm session |
| `/specbot live <url>` | Join a Google Meet and write the proposal live |
| `/specbot done` | End the active brainstorm session and finalise |
| `/specbot` | Show help |
| `update` *(in brainstorm thread)* | Force an immediate proposal refresh |
| `done` *(in brainstorm thread)* | Finalise from the thread |
| `@SpecBot <question>` | Ask a spec question mid-conversation |

---

## What gets logged

The Spec Activity Log Confluence page records:

| Event | Trigger | Recorded |
|---|---|---|
| ❓ Spec Question | Any `/specbot` or `@SpecBot` query | User name, question text, specs searched |
| 🧠 Brainstorm | Session ends via `done` | Who started it, mode (call/thread), link to proposal |
| ✏️ Spec Edit | Direct edit to any page in the spec space | Editor name, page title, link |

Spec edits require a Confluence webhook to be configured — see SETUP.md.

## Approximate running costs

| Service | Cost |
|---|---|
| Railway | Free tier / ~£4/month Pro |
| Anthropic API | ~£0.01–0.05 per session at this scale |
| Recall.ai | ~£0.52/hour of call time |
| Slack + Confluence | Existing plan — no extra cost |

**Estimated monthly total for a team under 10: under £15.**

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full step-by-step guide covering API keys, Railway deployment, Slack app creation, and Confluence webhook configuration.

## Notes

- Spec content is sent to the Anthropic API to generate answers. Anthropic's paid API plans include a zero data retention policy — inputs are not stored or used for training.
- Recall.ai receives meeting audio to produce transcripts. Review their [data processing terms](https://www.recall.ai) if this is a concern for your organisation.
- The bot answers spec questions strictly from Confluence content. If a spec doesn't cover a question, it says so explicitly rather than guessing.

# SpecBot

![SpecBot](assets/specbot-hero.jpeg)

A Slack bot that answers engineer questions from your Confluence specs, runs live AI-assisted brainstorm sessions, edits existing spec pages section by section, shows a changelog of what changed in a spec over any time period, and logs all spec activity to a master audit trail.

Built with Claude (Anthropic), Recall.ai, Confluence, and Slack. Deployable on Railway in under an hour.

---

## What it does

### 1. Spec Q&A
Engineers ask questions in Slack. SpecBot searches your Confluence spec pages, passes the relevant content to Claude, and returns a grounded answer with source links — no hallucination, no invention beyond what the spec says.

```
/specbot What is the error handling flow for the login feature?
@SpecBot Does the spec cover offline mode?
```

### 2. Live brainstorm → proposal (Slack thread)
Start a live session in Slack. Talk through the feature idea in the thread naturally. SpecBot builds a structured proposal in Confluence as you go, updating it every 60 seconds. When you're done, one command finalises and publishes it.

```
/specbot brainstorm
```

### 3. Live brainstorm → proposal (Google Meet)
SpecBot joins your Google Meet via Recall.ai, listens to the conversation in real time, and writes the proposal directly to a Confluence draft page as you talk. When the call ends, the proposal is finalised automatically.

```
/specbot live https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

### 4. Live spec update (Google Meet)
Point SpecBot at an existing spec page when joining a call. Instead of creating a new proposal, it monitors the conversation and patches only the sections where the team makes a concrete decision — directly updating the live spec page every 60 seconds.

```
/specbot live https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij | Payments v2 Spec
```

SpecBot will tell you in Slack exactly which sections it changed and why, e.g.:
> 📝 Spec patched — Payments v2 Spec
> • *Key Requirements*: Added PCI-DSS compliance requirement following Alice's confirmation
> • *Out of Scope*: Removed 3DS2 after team agreed to defer it

### 5. Section-specific spec editing
Edit a specific section of any existing Confluence spec page directly from Slack. Claude drafts the change and shows you a preview first — you approve, revise with new instructions, or discard before anything touches Confluence.

```
/specbot edit Payments v2 Spec | Key Requirements | Add a requirement for idempotent payment retries
/specbot edit Payments v2 Spec | Remove all references to the legacy API
```

Omitting the section name lets Claude decide which section the instruction most naturally applies to.

### 6. Spec changelog
Ask SpecBot what changed in any spec page over a given time period. It pulls the Confluence version history, compares the page before and after the period, and returns a human-readable section-by-section summary as a Slack post.

```
/specbot log Payments v2 Spec | last 7 days
/specbot log Payments v2 Spec | today
/specbot log Payments v2 Spec | 2026-04-01 to 2026-04-28
```

Supported time phrases: `today`, `yesterday`, `last N days`, `last week`, `this week`, or an explicit ISO date range.

### 7. Spec activity log
Every spec-related action is recorded to a master "Spec Activity Log" Confluence page — who asked what, who ran a brainstorm, who edited a spec page directly, and when. Newest entries appear first.

## Slack commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/specbot <question>` | Answer a question from the spec |
| `/specbot log <page> \| <time range>` | Show what changed in a spec over a time period |
| `/specbot edit <page> \| <instruction>` | Edit the most relevant section of a spec page |
| `/specbot edit <page> \| <section> \| <instruction>` | Edit a specific named section |
| `/specbot brainstorm` | Start a live Slack thread brainstorm session |
| `/specbot live <url>` | Join a Google Meet and write a new proposal live |
| `/specbot live <url> \| <page title>` | Join a Google Meet and update an existing spec live |
| `/specbot done` | End the active brainstorm or update session |
| `/specbot` | Show help |
| `update` *(in brainstorm thread)* | Force an immediate proposal refresh |
| `done` *(in brainstorm thread)* | Finalise from the thread |
| `@SpecBot <question>` | Ask a spec question mid-conversation |

**`/specbot` vs `@SpecBot`:** Slash commands (`/specbot`) go directly to the bot — your command isn't visible in the channel, only SpecBot's response is. App mentions (`@SpecBot`) are normal Slack messages that tag the bot, so they're visible to everyone in the thread. Both work for spec Q&A; only slash commands support brainstorm, edit, log, and live sessions. Use `@SpecBot` when you're already mid-conversation in a thread and want to ask a question inline.

## What gets logged

The Spec Activity Log Confluence page records:

| Event | Trigger | Recorded |
|---|---|---|
| ❓ Spec Question | Any `/specbot` or `@SpecBot` query | User name, question text, specs searched |
| 🧠 Brainstorm | Session ends via `done` | Who started it, mode (call/thread), link to proposal |
| ✏️ Spec Edit | `/specbot edit` approval, live update session ending, or direct Confluence page edit | Editor name, page title, link |

Direct Confluence spec edits require a Confluence webhook to be configured — see SETUP.md. Edits made via SpecBot are logged automatically without a webhook.

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full step-by-step guide covering API keys, Railway deployment, Slack app creation, and Confluence webhook configuration.

## Notes

- Spec content is sent to the Anthropic API to generate answers. Anthropic's paid API plans include a zero data retention policy — inputs are not stored or used for training.
- Recall.ai receives meeting audio to produce transcripts. Review their [data processing terms](https://www.recall.ai) if this is a concern for your organisation.
- The bot answers spec questions strictly from Confluence content. If a spec doesn't cover a question, it says so explicitly rather than guessing.
